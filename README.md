# AirBnB Clone Project

Welcome to the AirBnB Clone project! This project serves as a fundamental step in building a full web application, and it's important because the concepts and components you create here will be the building blocks for subsequent projects, including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, APIs, and front-end integration.

## Project Overview

The AirBnB Clone project is designed to replicate core features of the AirBnB platform, providing a simplified web application for listing and booking accommodations. This project includes the development of a command interpreter, creation of various classes for managing AirBnB objects, and implementation of a flexible storage system. Here are the main objectives of the project:

- Implement a parent class called "BaseModel" to handle the initialization, serialization, and deserialization of future instances.
- Create a simple data flow for serialization and deserialization: Instance ↔ Dictionary ↔ JSON string ↔ file.
- Develop all the necessary classes for AirBnB objects, such as User, State, City, Place, and more, all of which inherit from BaseModel.
- Create the first abstracted storage engine for the project, which is focused on file storage.
- Implement unit tests to validate all classes and the storage engine.

## What's a Command Interpreter?

A command interpreter, in the context of this project, is similar to a shell but tailored for a specific use case. It allows you to manage the objects within the AirBnB project. With this command interpreter, you can:

- Create new objects (e.g., a new User or a new Place).
- Retrieve objects from various sources, such as files or databases.
- Perform operations on objects, including counting and computing statistics.
- Update attributes of objects.
- Destroy objects, removing them from the system.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will have gained valuable knowledge and skills, including:

- Creating a Python package for organizing your project.
- Building a command interpreter in Python using the `cmd` module.
- Understanding the principles of unit testing and implementing it in a large project.
- Serializing and deserializing data objects, including writing and reading JSON files.
- Managing date and time information using the `datetime` module.
- Working with universally unique identifiers (UUIDs).
- Understanding and using `*args` and `**kwargs` for flexible function arguments.
- Handling named arguments in functions effectively.
